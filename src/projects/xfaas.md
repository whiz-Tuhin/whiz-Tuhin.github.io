XFaaS is a cross-cloud orchestration platform that enables seamless execution of serverless workflows across multiple cloud providers. It delivered 75% latency reductions and 57% cost savings through adaptive placement with telemetry-informed routing.

The system pairs dynamic workload placement with real-time telemetry to optimize function execution across AWS, Azure, and GCP. Industry partners adopted XFaaS to operationalize hybrid quantum-classical workflows.
